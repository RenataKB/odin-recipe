    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When was your last affogato? It's my go-to dessert at restaurants. Even if I claim I'm too full, affogato doesn't count as it's practically liquid, right? It's like having a glass of water! (Yes, really, that's how my mind works - don't judge me!)</p>
    <p>For those new to affogato, it's a traditional Italian coffee-dessert where hot espresso is poured over gelato or ice cream, with the option of adding a splash of liquor. It's coffee, dessert, and an after-dinner drink, all rolled into one. The contrast of hot, bitter coffee with cold, creamy ice cream is utter perfection. And the fact that it's so simple with a bonus DIY fun factor? Brilliant!</p>
