    <h1>Tuna Sandwich</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here's my classic tuna sandwich. Tuna in oil, not water. Juice from the pickle jar adds tang - oh, and let's use the pickles too! Dijon for flavour, dill for lovely herbiness, celery for crunch and green onion for freshness. Spread onto your favourite bread and enjoy!</p>
    <p>Maybe there are great tuna sandwiches out there. But why risk it when you can eat a sure thing at home, adding zing and freshness to transform fish out of a can into a sandwich filling so good you'll want to use it as a dip for dunking? (Oh yes I do!)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Tuna sandwich filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>425g/ 15 oz canned tuna in oil, drained</li>
        <li>150 g whole egg mayonnaise or Kewpie</li>
        <li>3/4 cup finely diced celery</li>
        <li>50 g finely chopped dill pickle</li>
        <li>2 tbsp liquid from pickle jar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>3 tbsp finely chopped dill (or parsley or basil)</li>
        <li>25 g finely sliced green onion</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For sandwiches</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 pieces butter lettuce (2 per sandwich)</li>
        <li>Salted butter, for spreading</li>
        <li>8 slices bread or 4 rolls</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Filling - Put all the Tuna Filling ingredients in a bowl. Mix well using a wooden spoon, breaking up the tuna so the filling becomes fairly smooth. The pickles and celery will take a beating too which is encouraged -> flavour melding!</li>
        <li>Sandwich - Divide Tuna Filling between 4 sandwiches (or more/less depending on bread size). I butter the bread and use 2 pieces of lettuce per sandwich. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
